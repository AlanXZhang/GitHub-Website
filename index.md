## Welcome to my website

My name is Xuesen (Alan) Zhang and I am a third year at the University of California, San Diego. I am a Data Scientist that is driven to optimize business operation through data analysis and visualization. Excited to work in a team environment to identify and solve real world problems and develop technical skills 
through hands-on experiences. Here, you can find projects that my team and I have worked on in the past.
